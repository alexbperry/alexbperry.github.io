        <h2>Who I Am</h2>
        <p>
            Hey, I'm Alex  
            I’m the kind of person who will build a website for fun, overthink a color palette,  
            and then go spend a whole afternoon on Fortnite to reset my brain.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>What I’m Into</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
            <strong>Making things look good:</strong>
            I love playing with layouts, colors, and little details until something finally “clicks.” Websites, dashboards, scrapbooks, you name it.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Data &amp; patterns:</strong>
            I will absolutely fall down a rabbit hole trying to turn messy information into something visual, simple, and satisfying.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Tech tinkering:</strong>
            Custom keyboards, random coding projects, dashboards, tiny tools that make life easier, or just building something because the idea won’t leave my brain.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Creative projects:</strong>
            Scrapbooks, surprise gifts, “just because” ideas, and anything that lets me mix design, photos, and little personal details.
            </li>
            <li>
            <strong>Games &amp; cozy chaos:</strong>
            Casual gaming sessions, silly ideas like cart ride games, and anything that feels a little unhinged but fun.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Work & Real-Life Me</h2>
        <p>
            When I’m not staring at a screen, I’ve spent summers up in a lifeguard stand watching over a pool,  
            and I’ve done my time in the fast-paced world of taking orders and juggling a million small tasks at once.  
            I like roles where I’m moving, problem-solving, and quietly keeping everything from falling apart.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>How I Treat People</h2>
        <p>
            I’m big on thoughtfulness: handwritten notes, custom playlists, small details,  
            and making people feel like I actually paid attention when they said they liked something once, six months ago.
        </p>

        <br>

        <h2>Random Alex Facts</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I will absolutely over-organize a project and then freestyle half of it anyway.</li>
            <li>I love sunset photos and little “snapshot” moments from everyday life.</li>
            <li>I’m always juggling at least three ideas at once: one technical, one creative, and one slightly chaotic.</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <h2>Currently Obsessed With</h2>
        <p>
            Turning ideas into actual, clickable, scrollable, tangible things — whether that’s a tiny tool,  
            a personal project, or a page just like this one.
