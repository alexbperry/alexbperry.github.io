    <h2>What I’m Into</h2>
    <p>
        When I am not working on a project, I usually hop on Xbox for a bit. 
        I mess around in the new Skate game, play a few Fortnite matches, 
        or just zone out for a while. I am not a heavy gamer and it is really just how I reset. 
        I also love the Triangle area. It has a big city feel without being overwhelming, 
        and it is easily my favorite part of North Carolina.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of that, I like doing fun and slightly chaotic things for no real reason. 
        Casual gaming sessions, silly ideas, random side projects 
        <em>(making games in Roblox sucks!)</em>. 
        I enjoy anything that feels light and creative.
    </p>

    <h2>Work &amp; Real-Life Me</h2>
    <p>
        When I’m not behind a screen, I’m usually outside or moving around. I’ve spent summers up in a lifeguard stand watching over a pool,
        and I’ve survived the wild world of taking orders, juggling small tasks, and keeping everything running smoothly. 
        I like jobs where I’m doing something, thinking ahead, and quietly keeping chaos under control.

    <h2>Random Alex Facts</h2>
    <p>
        My guitar is basically my best friend. I'm not that great but I like to pretend I am. 
        <p>
        I take way too many sunset photos in random parking lots.   </p>
        <p>
        This is probably my 100th version of “Alex Perry’s blog” website.
